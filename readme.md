## Introduction
Tips, explanations and cues for some of the more unintuitive strats in Glyph go here. I'm going to be assuming knowledge of basic speedtech. 
Glyph is really fun. You should play it.
You can always DM me at wpxtmvpsxm#5957 if you have any questions.

## Wallboosts
Wallboosts are an uncommon tech in the basegame but because Glyph has disabled neutral jumps as well as the prevalence of vertically falling blocks, 
wallboosts are a major timesave and used throughout the map.
A basic explanation of [wallboosts](https://twitter.com/MaddyThorson/status/1238338585708781568) is that after a neutral climbjump you can press away from the wall,
and the game will give you a stamina refund and 'convert' your jump into a wallkick. The reason this is important is that a normal wallkick forces Madeline to behave
as if you're holding away from the wall for a significant amount of time, whereas a wallboost does not have this limitation. So, you can use them to move a smaller distance from the wall,
or you can press towards the wall to quickly regrab it (and gain a small amount of height).
The most common use in Glyph is to grab a falling block, wallboost in order to let go of it and make it fall sooner, and then regrab the block to climbjump over it as it falls.

## Pause buffered demodashes
This is not necessary or particularly Glyph-specific, but there are a few demodashes that become trivial when pause-buffered, for minimal timeloss compared to not taking the demo. 
If you're not familiar with pause buffering, the gist is that you can buffer a pause input out of the menu-unpausing animation, which will advance the game physics 1 frame and repause.
When you are dealing with 1f demodashes, this is of course invaluable with or without a visual cue.
A useful tip is to bind a Journal key (which makes the pause menu invisible) to your grab button or somewhere else you can comfortably hold while pausing/unpausing the game.
