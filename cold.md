note: cold-14 is better for debug warping   
  
  Do a tiny wallboost to line up the first wallbounce, otherwise do a wallkick, updash and climbjump. For the second wallbounce, jump as late as possible to get maximum height on the 3rd wallbounce. If you miss it, you can wallboost (like how you would neutral jump) to easily get around the ledge without a dash.

  Hopefully the center camera view makes it clear what you should do here. Try not to activate the righthand block if possible. Upleft demo should make this more lenient.

Tap jump for the wavedash and aim to wavedash on the centre of the falling block. You can only wallkick after you uncrouch from the diag demo, but it's very consistent if you are far left enough on left dash through the dash crystal. Use leniency pixels on the final wallbounce if you need to.

  Hold onto the first block for a split second before wallkicking to do the demohyper. Wallboosts are essential for the lenient version, less essential for the cornerkick version (faster).

  More lenient version of this skip below, loses about a second total

   Don't buffer jump on the 'spike climbjump' to make it a lot kinder with regards to how long you hold jump for. The wallboost after the wallbounce is nice but non-essential. On death, a demohyper makes bonking at the start much easier.
