   Full height jump, upleft, don't buffer the updash, hold left during/after the updash.

These are comfy strats while still hitting the same cycles as all but the stupidest fast stuff. The only mildly tight thing is the 'cycle skip' gultra, but you don't even need to gultra to make it through- and of course if you mess the cycle up you can freely wait it out. 
  The end skip is reachable with just a demohyper, though a gultra makes it easier to land cleanly on the block. If you don't land on the block, don't climbjump (hold up to climb onto it instead) then demohyper to the finish.

Don't be afraid to stay on the moveblock for as long as you need to lineup the first wallbounce. Be sure to wallbounce late to get max height everywhere.
Because stamina is no longer an issue with this strat you can get to and activate the moveblock slightly earlier by buffering right dashes and grabbing it lower down.

   The upleft into the spring is a bit stinky because there isn't a totally consistent way to do it. Wallkick leftdash updash is much more consistent.
Fullheight hyper, then right demo and instantly hold downright to stay crouched and slide under the lightning.

   This is more worth than the other (hail mary) version- it's much less costly to miss and still saves 1s+. Get on the block, buffer downdash and then hyper bhop. If you're consistently early, extend the hyper a tiny amount.

Caeyo's strat. You should really only go for this if your run is already dead, but it's super fun. Do one downdash, wait a tiny bit, and then hyper bhop. You can horizontal cb or upright cb, I find upright easier.

stand at the cue (there are a couple of pixels that work so don't worry too much about the distortion effect), jump, and upleft just below the peak of the jump. The upleft is a 4 frame window but the game is running at 50% speed so it's more like 8f.   
  Aim for later in the window because the consequences of dashing too early are *way* worse than dashing too late.  
   If you don't attempt this, you can simply updemo into the transition to save 2s over an updash, but there is no reason not to try the skip imo.
