   Updemo buffered wallbounce gives you the perfect height at the start.  
   
   A neutral super lines up the reverse wavedash so long as you jump pretty late on the wavedash itself. The next fastest easy alternative is to [left dash into right demohyper](https://gfycat.com/FortunateFrighteningIvorygull)

   Whenever you are doing a wallkick -> updash, replace it with a wallboost -> updash for decent free timesave

  The green box is the teleport trigger, the red box is the slowdown trigger. Aim to updash at the visual cue (between the lines) but if you updash after the green line you can hold right and lose very little time.

   Comet's lineup. Jump at the flower in the background, updash at the peak of the jump, and then start holding right during the dash.

   Tap jump as short as possible on the transition hyper, immediately hold left, buffer a full height wallkick on the moveblock and win

Boss219's strat- this one is tough. Don't fast fall, start the wallbounce at the right-hand red line and full height jump as late as possible, then tap left enough to reach the other red line (right-hand side of the dash crystal). Start holding right + climbjump as late as possible.

   Jump as far left as you can before the demohyper so you can do the ultra nice and fast after you jump. Land on the wooden thing and just hold downright to slide

There is only one pixel that Madeline can have her feet 'together' like this and still be too far right to get the wallbounce, and missing the wallbounce like that won't kill you. Hold left on the wb and press right soon after you jump for the wb. The further right you are on the block, the later you should press right after wallbouncing.
