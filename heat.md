## Fair Warning
Heat contains a bunch of demodashes, including a few that save upwards of 10 seconds. In the most recent update of Glyph, the two most important demos were made significantly easier, but this checkpoint can definitely still be frustrating. Remember to be patient with yourself but don't hesitate to cut out a strat if it doesn't work for you after you've given it a fair shot. 
## Yep, this is HeatðŸ¥µ

  A wallkick will cancel the crouch state of an upright demodash and uncrouch you into the spring. Left dash into the spring again so that you hit the top of it which will line you up for the next strat- hold down, left and grab after the updash into the coin and you will easily grab the bottom of the switch block if you didn't updash too late. You can also slowfall straight downward and grab the block the same way, though I can't vouch for that strat's reliability.

   This is probably the biggest timesave in the level. This demo is significantly easier now, but you still need to warp inside the moveblock to complete the strat. Any further left than the image above will successfully warp you inside the block and clip you to the top of it. Practically this means you will need to be further right and then hold left as you pass the spinner which sticks out at you. It is *possible* to fall straight down past the spinner and get the warp, but not very consistent.

Another interesting use of a wallboost here- do one instead of a wallkick to trigger the coin and return to the wall in time to *then* wallkick and wallbounce, saving one dash and skipping using the left wall. Also note the demohyper at the start of the clip- significantly faster than the 'squish'.

   The first demo is not at the peak of a jump but slightly below. It's very lenient and lines up perfectly from an extended super on death and from a hyper bhop through the screen transition on entry. It doesn't save too much time but it's a "why not" demo.  
     The second demo saves 9+ seconds. There isn't an easy lineup but the gap is pretty wide. This is worth pause buffering if you can't do it pauseless.
     Finally, the third demo is the easiest of all. It's as wide as the others and because of the horizontal dashes, you won't be falling at maximum speed, giving you more frames to demo on.

   This demo is worth the time to pause buffer but is relatively minor. Doing a climbjump then a wallboost avoids getting floorsnapped to the falling block when you demo. Go neutral and fastfall after the demo.

This is the other demo that was made significantly easier in patch 2.3- it's still relatively challenging because you need to climb without activating the moveblock, but it can be 100% consistent with some practice. After hitting the spring, hold right until the place indicated in the image, then buffer a neutral climbjump into a wallkick, then demo.
