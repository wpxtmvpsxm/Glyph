## Fair Warning
Heat contains a bunch of demodashes, including a few that save upwards of 10 seconds. In the most recent update of Glyph two of these demos were made significantly easier, but this checkpoint can definitely still be frustrating. Remember to be patient with yourself but don't hesitate to cut out a strat if it doesn't work for you after you've given it a fair shot. 
## Yep, this is Heat.

  A wallkick will cancel the crouch state of an upright demodash and uncrouch you into the spring. Left dash into the spring again so that you hit the top of it which will line you up for the next strat- hold down, left and grab after the updash into the coin and you will easily grab the bottom of the switch block if you didn't updash too late. You can also slowfall straight downward and grab the block the same way, though I can't vouch for that strat's reliability.

   This is probably the biggest timesave in the level. This demo is significantly easier now, but you still need to warp inside the moveblock to complete the strat. Any further left than the image above will successfully warp you inside the block and clip you to the top of it. Practically this means you will need to be further right and then hold left as you pass the spinner which sticks out at you. It is *possible* to fall straight down past the spinner and get the warp, but not very consistent.

   To enter this room, do a wavedash > cb > wavedash again to have consistent speed. You can hold downright until the first row of spinners.

   After the first diagonal, this cue helps to set up the next diagonal > right dash.

   For this demo, wait until Madeline is lined up to the bottom of the giant green crystal. For the last two gaps, you can fastfall and go neutral after each left dash.
