Doing the demohyper upright with a dashjump bind will make the start much easier, though it is still essential to jump very late on the demohyper. The trick to this room is to not buffer your dashes. You'll generally be breaking blocks in the frames after a dash has ended but you're still "sort of" dashing, which lets you enter dreamblocks and break blocks.  
  
  In the next room, be sure to buffer your climbjumps and demohyper on the moving block *before* it starts to move. The place to land before the demohyper is tricky at first but can be 100% consistent.

  Try to buffer climbjumps to not activate the block until you hit the spring. Don't buffer the upleft dash or you  will hit the spring again. Demohyper quickly after you land. Don't worry about extending the demohyper, just get enough distance to reach the end. If you aren't high enough you can still touch the portal below the platform which will set your respawn to the end of the room.

Another interesting use of a wallboost here- do one instead of a wallkick to trigger the coin and return to the wall in time to *then* wallkick and wallbounce, saving one dash and skipping using the left wall. Also note the demohyper at the start of the clip- significantly faster than the 'squish'.

   The first demo is not at the peak of a jump but slightly below. It's very lenient and lines up perfectly from an extended super on death and from a hyper bhop through the screen transition on entry. It doesn't save too much time but it's a "why not" demo.  
     The second demo saves 9+ seconds. There isn't an easy lineup but the gap is pretty wide. This is worth pause buffering if you can't do it pauseless.
     Finally, the third demo is the easiest of all. It's as wide as the others and because of the horizontal dashes, you won't be falling at maximum speed, giving you more frames to demo on.

   This demo is worth the time to pause buffer but is relatively minor. Doing a climbjump then a wallboost avoids getting floorsnapped to the falling block when you demo. Go neutral and fastfall after the demo.
     If you want to do the 'casual strat' [do this with a buffered neutral updemo wallbounce.](https://gfycat.com/QuaintEagerJaeger

This is the other demo that was made significantly easier in patch 2.3- it's still relatively challenging because you need to climb without activating the moveblock, but it can be 100% consistent with some practice. After hitting the spring, hold right until the place indicated in the image, then buffer a neutral climbjump into a wallkick, then demo.
