Doing the demohyper upright with a dashjump bind will make the start much easier, though it is still essential to jump very late on the demohyper. The trick to this room is to not buffer your dashes. You'll generally be breaking blocks in the frames after a dash has ended but you're still "sort of" dashing, which lets you enter dreamblocks and break blocks.  
  
  In the next room, be sure to buffer your climbjumps and demohyper on the moving block *before* it starts to move. The place to land before the demohyper is tricky at first but can be 100% consistent.

  Try to buffer climbjumps to not activate the block until you hit the spring. Don't buffer the upleft dash or you  will hit the spring again. Demohyper quickly after you land. Don't worry about extending the demohyper, just get enough distance to reach the end. If you aren't high enough you can still touch the portal below the platform which will set your respawn to the end of the room.

The ultra at the start of this gif should be very hard to die to.   
  For the RCB, stand in front of the tree in the background, do a demohyper and then an upleft demo. You need a bit more height to get it consistently so don't jump on the last frame of your dash for the demohyper.
In the next room, buffer a right climbjump, making sure to hold jump down and not just tap it (so the buffer goes through) and be ready to upright. 
You shouldn't expect 100% consistency on this strat but it costs very little to lose. 
The strat to use if you miss the RCB is this:

   This demo is very worth pausebuffering as it skips an entire room. There is a weird pauseless 5jump setup you can copy from TGH's 10:56 if you are interested, but the pause buffer setup is as follows: 
  - Jump above the building in the background
  - Slow-fall and pause buffer until the **second frame** that Maddy's feet touch the building (the red line in the cue)
  - Buffer demo.

The disadvantage of the previous is that you don't set your respawn point for the second half of the room, but luckily there is a demo which is easier than the casual strat with the correct setup, and usually impossible without (yay for subpixels!!).
  - Dash into the ceiling to bonk your head (this works with either of the two ceilings above you)
  - fall down (**don't fastfall**) into the pink dash crystal
  - Buffer an updash as you touch the crystal
  - At the peak of your dash (don't buffer this), demodash left.
  
The setup for the third demo is a full height reverse super, holding jump right up until you start pausing. A faster alternative is to fall and then left dash directly to the dash crystal. You should still get a 1f window.

Hold up to climb onto/over the block and immediately wavedash. You don't need to extend it because of the double dash. Make sure to jump late on the demohyper to make it to the next block.

Aiming the down diags is the most important thing here, give yourself enough room to extend the hyper because you don't have time to readjust. Buffer the dashes for the hypers.
